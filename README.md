# Mechanisms of gestural alignment
This repository contains the following:

- Python scripts used for extracting gestural alignment and computing DTW distance scores
- R scripts used for statistical analyses
- Processed, anonymized data

For reviewing the R scripts within GitHub, we recommend that readers check the `.md` files that are optimized for GitHub. If you wish to review them on your computer, then we recommend that you check the `.html` files.

## User guide
If users wish to run the kinematic analyses (e.g., DTW distance computation), please download the MediaPipe motion tracking data from the [OSF repository](https://osf.io/v3y8r/overview?view_only=67f73ccd937a4d99b7f1829b8369c155) and place them in the `Python/dtw/data/mediapipe` directory before running the scripts.
